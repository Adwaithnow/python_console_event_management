# Python Event Management
**Project Description:**

This project is a timetable management system that allows users to create, update, delete, and print timetables. The system supports scheduling events during the work hours of 9am-5pm, and events must have no overlap in their duration. Users can also print a list of all the events scheduled on a selected day of the week in chronological order. The system also supports storing (saving and loading) the timetable data on a file with a provided filename.

**Functional Requirements:**

-   The program must start with printing out the title and the author's name and UniSA email.
-   The program must provide a text-based prompt or a menu so that a user can interactively perform various actions to manage the timetable, until deciding to quit.
-   User inputs must be validated (e.g., wrong data type, out of range, or not among the provided options) and asked again with proper error messages if invalid.
-   A user must be able to create, update, and delete a scheduled event. An event must have a title, when it starts and ends, and optionally where it is held. Identifying an event for updating or deleting it should be based on the start time of the event.
-   The timetable must at least support scheduling events during the work hours of 9am-5pm.
-   Scheduling an event must support at least hour level granularity (11am, 3pm, etc.).
-   Events must have no overlap in their duration. When creating or updating an event, the start and end time must be checked against other events to ensure there is no overlap. If a user tries to schedule an event that overlaps with another event, an error message should be displayed and ask the user to reschedule the event.
-   A user must be able to print the timetable which gives an overview of the schedule for the whole week. This should include as much details as possible, but may abbreviate (eg, long title or location) or omit certain details (e.g., end time or location) of each event as needed to make them fit into a table formatting.
-   A user must be able to print a list of all the events scheduled on a selected day of the week in chronological order. This should provide full details of each event (without any abbreviation or details omitted) on the selected day.
-   A user must be able to store (save and load) the timetable data on a file with provided filename.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**

-   The system must be user-friendly and easy to use.
-   The system must be efficient and able to handle large timetables.
-   The system must be reliable and should not crash or lose data.
-   The system must be secure and protect user data from unauthorized access.

**Project Schedule:**

-   The project will be completed in 6 weeks.
-   The first week will be spent on planning and requirements gathering.
-   The second week will be spent on designing the system.
-   The third week will be spent on coding the system.
-   The fourth week will be spent on testing the system.
-   The fifth week will be spent on documenting the system.
-   The sixth week will be spent on deploying the system.

**Project Budget:**

The project budget is $1,000. This budget will cover the cost of software licenses, hardware, and personnel.

**Project Risks:**

The main risks associated with this project are:

-   The project may not be completed on time or within budget.
-   The system may not meet the user requirements.
-   The system may not be secure or reliable.

**Project Mitigation Strategies:**

The following mitigation strategies will be used to address the risks associated with this project:

-   The project schedule and budget will be closely monitored to ensure that the project stays on track.
-   The user requirements will be gathered and documented carefully to ensure that the system meets the needs of the users.
-   The system will be tested thoroughly to ensure that it is secure and reliable.
